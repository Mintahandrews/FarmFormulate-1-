Project Title:
AgroIntel AI – Intelligent Multilingual Survey, Advisory, and Data Quality Platform

1. Problem Summary
   A. Language & Communication Barriers
   • Issue:
   o Farmers predominantly speak local dialects and are often unfamiliar with English.
   o Esoko’s current communications (SMS alerts, voice messages) are either in English or manually recorded in local languages, which is time-consuming and inconsistent.
   B. Manual & Inconsistent Form/Survey Generation
   • Issue:
   o Esoko—and its partners (NGOs, agronomy advisors)—need custom forms and surveys to collect field data (e.g., agronomic conditions, crop health, market feedback) but creating these is manual and prone to human error.
   o Resulting forms can lack the necessary quality assurance, leading to poor data quality.
   C. Data Quality Assurance Challenges
   • Issue:
   o Data collected from farmers is sometimes incomplete, inconsistent, or inaccurate.
   o There is a need for automated checks that validate and standardize incoming data for better decision-making.
   D. Voice-based Communications
   • Issue:
   o Esoko uses voice messages to communicate with farmers; however, recording human voices in multiple languages is not scalable.
   o There is no automated mechanism to convert text updates into high-quality, natural-sounding voice messages in local dialects.

2. Proposed Solutions
   A. AI-Generated Survey/Form Builder
   • What It Does:
   o Allows the user (Esoko staff or partners) to prompt the AI by saying, for example, “Create a survey to assess maize yield and pest impact in Bono East.”
   o The AI generates a complete survey form with:
   ▪ Relevant fields and logical validations to ensure quality (data QA).
   ▪ Built-in instructions and dynamic branching questions based on context.
   ▪ Automatic translation of the form into targeted local dialects.
   o Benefits:
   ▪ Saves time, ensures consistency, and improves data quality.
   B. Multilingual AI Communication Platform
   • Text-to-Speech (TTS) & Speech-to-Text (STT):
   o What It Does:
   ▪ Converts Esoko’s text-based content (weather alerts, agronomy advice) into natural-sounding voice messages in local languages.
   ▪ Enables farmers to send voice queries that are transcribed and translated into actionable insights.
   o Benefits:
   ▪ Increases accessibility for farmers with low literacy.
   ▪ Delivers timely, localized information without requiring manual recordings.
   C. Smart Data Quality Assurance and Dashboard
   • What It Does:
   o Automates checks on survey responses and collected data to flag inconsistencies, incomplete entries, or anomalies.
   o Provides a dashboard for Esoko staff to visualize real-time data, identify trends, and quickly address data quality issues.
   o Benefits:
   ▪ Enhances the reliability of the data Esoko collects.
   ▪ Supports better decision-making in agronomy advisories and commodity market predictions.
   D. Integration and Interoperability
   • What It Does:
   o Integrates with Esoko’s existing platforms (SMS, USSD, WhatsApp) for broader farmer reach.
   o Optionally, links with their database of farmers and warehouse inventory, helping to correlate survey data with supply chain activities.
   o Benefits:
   ▪ Creates a seamless workflow from data collection to actionable insights.
   ▪ Offers a unified interface for stakeholders (Esoko, NGOs, processors).

3. Core AI Tools & Techniques
   Component
   Technique/Tool
   Purpose
   Form Generator
   GPT-based model (with LangChain integration)
   Convert text prompts into smart, dynamic survey forms
   Translation Module
   Google Translate API / Custom fine-tuning (LLM for local dialects)
   Translate forms and communications to local languages
   Quality Assurance (QA)
   Rule-based validation augmented with fine-tuned LLM reasoning
   Automatically detect and flag inconsistencies in responses
   TTS/STT
   OpenAI Whisper (for STT) and Coqui TTS (for TTS), potentially fine-tuned for local dialects
   Enable automated multilingual voice interactions
   Dashboard & Backend
   MERN stack or similar, with integration of data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js)
   Monitor, analyze, and visualize survey responses in real time

4. Impact & Benefits
   Stakeholder
   Impact & Benefits
   Farmers

- Receive timely, culturally and linguistically appropriate advisories.
- Engage easily via voice or SMS surveys for feedback.
  Esoko
- Reduces manual overhead of survey creation and voice recording.
- Improves data quality for smarter agronomy advice.
- Enhances farmer engagement and market responsiveness.
  NGOs & Partners
- Access to high-quality data to better tailor their interventions and programs.
  Local Economy
- Better-informed farmers drive increased productivity and market efficiency, potentially lowering commodity prices and boosting local processing.

5. Additional Considerations for Kickstarting the Project
   • Pilot Phase:
   o Begin with one region or crop (e.g., maize or cocoa) to refine the form generator and language components.
   o Collaborate with select farmers and a few Esoko field officers for real-world testing.
   • Data Collection & Model Fine-Tuning:
   o Leverage Esoko’s existing farmer database to gather initial language and survey data.
   o Fine-tune the TTS/STT models with local dialect samples to improve accuracy.
   • User Feedback & Iteration:
   o Collect user feedback from farmers interacting via voice and surveys.
   o Iteratively update the QA logic and translation models to better meet local expectations.
   • Project Roadmap & Timeline:
   o Define a 3–4 month MVP timeline to build core modules.
   o Plan integration with Esoko’s systems and roll-out for beta testing with a subset of users.
   • Collaboration Opportunities:
   o Engage language experts or local universities for enhanced dialect accuracy.
   o Partner with Esoko’s in-house tech team to ensure smooth integration with their infrastructure.

This comprehensive outline should provide a robust foundation to pitch and kickstart your project with Esoko. It directly addresses their pain points while leveraging AI to create a dynamic, multilingual, and quality-focused tool for farmer engagement.
